We made a setup where you can trigger colored leds and play a different sound with a piezo buzzer depending on which of the four buttons is pressed. There is also a potentiometer that controls the input to the piezo buzzer.

   We set out to build a game similar to simon says but we settled with a piano thing that makes noises and lights up. We started by assembling the circuits on the breadboard and then worked on programming code so it worked. This was not an easy task because our arduino was very sensitive to tables for an unknown reason. We eventually cleared that up by changing some of our code but we do not know why the table was impacting the performance of our game. Another difficulty was actually making simon says because it proved to be too difficult and time consuming after we spent so much time fixing the table thing so yeah. Another issue we encountered was our piezo buzzer was malfunctioning and making horrible screeching noises. We thought all buzzers sounded like that until we replaced it with a new one that wasn't broken. We collaborated at some points in the project and worked independently at other times. It is hard to say who did what, but the project was completed and our arduino project is bug-free and that is what matters in the end.
