    Story
  </h1>
<p1>
  You wake up on a beach in the middle of the wreckage of your private plane. You look around and find that you are on a tropical island with jungles and a mountain further inland; and you find that the sun is right above your head, which means that it is sometime in the afternoon. The last thing that you remember is going on vacation to the Bahama islands with your friends during a storm; your initial plan was to go the Bahamas to spend time with your family that lives there. 

You search through the remains of the plane, and gather some materials; but your friends are nowhere to be found. 

Once you gather materials (batteries, snacks, water, etc.) and explore the island more, you notice that there are footprints on the shore, which leads to the suspicion that your friends are somewhere on the island, but you are not able to locate them. 

You start following the footprints, and after following them for 30 minutes, the footprints head inland from the beach into the jungle. 

You continue to follow the footsteps, and after a little bit, you find that they lead towards the mountain and you suspect that your friends are most likely at the top or near the mountain.

 You hike to the bottom of the mountain, and you finally see Nolan. You ask him whether or not if he knows where his friends are, but he does not have an answer. 

But the sun is going down, and you can not waste time asking him more questions. You and Nolan start making a fire, and start gathering materials in order to create shelter. 

You are about to sleep, but you hear a rattling around in the distance, near the bushes. You find out that it was your friends, Aaron and Emily. 

The only person that is left is Kylie, and you start searching for her after you fall asleep. You and your friends go back to the plane, and you see that Kylie is there looting the remains of the plane. 

She explains that she found a satellite phone at the pilotâ€™s cockpit, but does not have enough altitude for a good connection in order to make a phone call to the emergency service. Then, Aaron makes a suggestion that climbing the mountain is the best form of gaining altitude, and everyone agrees on it.

 After looting the plane for awhile, you and your friends gather enough materials and resources to climb the mountain. 

You and your friends head back to where you and Nolan created a camp, and you and your friends start climbing the mountain. 

After an hour, you and your friends reach the summit of the mountain, and Kylie starts making the phone call to the emergency service. 

3 hours later, the emergency service arrive, and you and your friends safely and successfully leave the island, and go to your families house.

  The first challenge was faced was deciding what the text adventure was going to be about. 
  I myself had a good amount of trouble developing our game because it was my first time coding with python and I didn't know what I was doing. 
  After much trial and error we finally figured out how to make the game run past the first option and it was pretty straight forward from there.
  Our game works very well except it seems that we may have missed the main point of the project which was to learn how to use functions. 
  We didn't really properly utilize functions in our game, but we still learned how to use them in the end.
